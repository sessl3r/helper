Collection of very random scripts which do not belong to anything else.

## Memmingen Airport Tour

Simple Python script to poll a API endpoint and check for free palces
for the Airport Tour (Kids) on the Memmingen Airport.
The script gets called by a systemd.timer service and sends out a
mail if a new schedule is available.
